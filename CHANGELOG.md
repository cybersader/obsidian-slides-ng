## [Unreleased]

### Added

- M1 scaffold: bun + esbuild + TypeScript build pipeline
- Minimal `SlidesNGPlugin` and `SlidesNGView` skeleton (empty preview pane)
- Ribbon icon and command palette entry for "Slides NG: open preview"
- M1.5 test infrastructure: WebdriverIO (`wdio-obsidian-service`) smoke
  spec, iframe-aware E2E helpers, `bun test` scaffolding, auto-reload
  esbuild hook (`bun run dev:reload`) wired to Obsidian's official CLI
- `.claude/skills/obsidian-cli/SKILL.md` and `.claude/skills/testing-patterns/SKILL.md`
- M2 static renderer:
  - `parseDeck()` — wraps `@slidev/parser` to slice markdown into slides
    with frontmatter, content, and speaker notes
  - `renderDeck()` — slides → marked-rendered HTML → reveal.js-ready
    `<section>` markup → full iframe-srcdoc document
  - reveal.js + reveal CSS + 3 themes (black, white, simple) inlined at
    build time via `scripts/generate-reveal-assets.mjs` — zero network
    requests at runtime
  - `SlidesNGView` mounts an `<iframe sandbox="allow-scripts">` and writes
    the rendered HTML to `srcdoc`; toolbar has a Reload button
  - Open-preview command passes the active markdown file's path to the view
  - Unit tests: `parseDeck.test.ts` + `renderDeck.test.ts` (12 tests total)
